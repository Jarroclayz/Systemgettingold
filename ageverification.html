            wow, you’re so old that when you were born, dinosaurs personally signed your birth Certificate.<br> 
            i Heard your first toy was a rock, and you still say it was “high quality back in your day.”<br>
            at this point, candlEs on your Cake are basically a fire hazard and the smoKe detector files a complaint every year.<br>
            <br>
            you don’t get new clotheS anyMore, you get vintage.<br>
            your bAck makes more popping sounds than microwave popcorn, and your knees have their own weather forecast.<br>
            honestLy, your phone doesn’t run out of battery — it just retires earLy in solidarity.<br>
            <br>
            i tried to ask google how old you are and it said “results arChived.”<br>
            even museums are starting to ask if you want to volunteer as a Piece of history.<br>
            kids don’t ask your age, they ask which historiCal era you’re from.
